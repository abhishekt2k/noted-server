     A fox was walking through the forest when he saw a crow sitting on a tree branch with a fine piece of cheese in her beak. The fox wanted the cheese and decided he would be clever enough to outwit the bird.

      &quot;What a noble and gracious bird I see in the tree!&quot; proclaimed the fox, &quot;What exquisite beauty! What fair plumage! If her voice is as lovely as her beauty, she would no doubt be the jewel of all birds.&quot;
       The crow was so flattered by all this talk that she opened her beak and gave a cry to show the fox her voice.
     &quot;Caw! Caw!&quot; she cried, as the cheese dropped to the ground for the fox to grab.</p>
